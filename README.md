# GIFmaker
Simple GIF maker in python using Pillow

Make sure you have a Python Interpreter installed and the Pillow package installed. 

Python installation: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Pillow installation: https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/

In main.py, replace "chameleon.jpg" with the image file of your choice. Make sure it is in the same directory as main.py otherwise you will need to provide the absolute path.
Run main.py and it should add different images to the frames folder and create a GIF called myGIF.gif in the directory.
